Singly Linked List\n","Structure: Each node in a singly linked list contains two parts: the data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

This type of list allows traversal in only one direction.\n","\n","2. Doubly Linked List\n","Structure: Each node in a doubly linked list has three parts: the data, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node. This allows movement in both directions.\n","Working: You can start at the head and move forward through the list using the next pointers, or you can start at the end (called the tail) and move backward using the previous pointers. This bidirectional traversal makes certain operations more efficient.\n","\n","3. Circular Linked List\n","Structure: Similar to a singly linked list, but the last node points back to the first node instead of pointing to None. This creates a circular structure.\n","Working: You can start at any node and follow the next pointers to traverse the entire list. Since the last node points back to the first, you can keep going around in a loop. This is useful for applications where you need to cycle through the list repeatedly."],"metadata":{"id":"xj0GLzZKA7CL"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"9J5Yoz81A9BX"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
